## tech

For this app I used the following techniques:
- Next
- React Server Components
- Tailwindcss
- Typescript
- Eslint
- Jest and Testing Library
- localStorage

### why next

One of the main benefits of Next is that it enables SSR (server-side rendering). This means the server can generate the HTML for a page and send it to the client, rather than the client generating the HTML using JavaScript. This can improve the performance and SEO of your app. 

Also the developer experience, more performance and flexibility has improved in the new release of next 13, where you can now use React Server (async) Components, a very intuitive file-based routing and streaming. 

## testing

The requested unit tests have been added using Jest and Testing Library. Ideally I would add at least one test per component. However, I was a bit short on time. Also, normally I like to add Integration and E2E tests using puppeteer and cypress. 

## responsiveness

This app includes responsiveness for all resolutions.

## accessibility
